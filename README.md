C++, C# and OpenGL Exercises

These are some Exercises I did mainly with C++.
The Exercises are in the directories called "Uebungsblatt_XX". I added a .pdf file in the Exercises_sheet directory to have a better
understanding what these Exercises are all about.

Additionally I have in the solution some directories for example the "Miscellaneous" Directory with programms which help me 
understand some C++ specific operations. 

And I have some OpenGL specific tasks which I wrote as a training for myself. These can be found in the "Drawing_Geometry" directory
in the solution.
For the OpenGL part you need to have the references for some additional libs in your solution. 

for the Glut libs I created in my SDK-directory a folder called CG_GLUT_DIR in which includes the specific libs;
further in my SDK-directory you need a reference called CG_GLEW_DIR;
next in the SDK-directory you need CG_GLFW_DIR;

for better understanding with the exercises and how to set the path-variables to these libs have 
a look at http://www.videotutorialsrock.com/index.php

I haven't finished all these exercises yet, but they give you a good understanding how OpenGL works.
